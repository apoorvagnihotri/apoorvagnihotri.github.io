I want to imagine some kind of tool for writers, so I need to write something and create an interactive webpage myself. This will allow me to imagine what works best for people in the future. The worst case is that I create my own website. For that I need to figure out the process of creating a website based on some kind of imagination.

First, I will limit the scope of the website to be without a database, without multiple pages just using standard node modules, html and css.

I think, designing the website is the first step. We can choose what to have on the website. It will help figure out the design that might work best.

A personal website should always have an overview and a timeline on the first page. I just pay attention to my first page right now.

#### Key Objectives

* I want to make it easy for a person visiting my website to get my narrative.
  * What I am focusing on right now. I want to make them feel invited to talk.
    * Building tooling for writers.
    * Focused on education.
  * Some history
  * Links
  * Explore


#### Content

 * Overview
    I'm a builder at heart. I love writing expository articles that use interactivness to better explain ideas. Having built an article (distill) earlier, I found it hard to recreate similarly spirited articles. I believe that we are currently limited by tooling to build more such expositions. Have you ever felt having been limited by the writing tools we have? We should talk.

    How did I get here? I started my bachelors at IIT Gandhinagar and got to work with Prof. Nipun. His projects often revolved around visualizations (vayu). Working with him gave me an appreciation for visualizations. Later when I joined Wadhwani AI, a non-profit, I remember having wrote another article to explain one of our projects in tuberculosis (https://www.wadhwaniai.org/2021/03/giving-lpa-a-hand/). If the article had been interactive, I believe it would have been so much more engaging. I want to help writers to convey insights better while giving life to their content which gives the reader an opportunity to explore and learn.

 * Timeline
 * Links

 * [AI Assistant](#ai-assistant): Would you like to know more? Ask away on this interactive webpage. 
   * Initially we can just have a chat box to chat with an AI that knows about me.
   * I will note down all the interactions in some database (mongodb). I want to note down (without asking the user to login): 
     * IP address
     * Conversation history
     * Timestamp
     * Google analytics unique ID for this perticular user. I understand that I have google analytics on my website, but I want to link a user to the conversation history.
   * Maintaining a conversational history for any user.

#### Design

 * Overview
   * This is basically an overview of the person I am. 


#### Insights

* Whenever a writer is writing an article, they might have a key takeaway they want the readers to understand. Having access to key takeaways, or asking them to fill these up would help them stay on track. This defining of goals upfront might help the AI to better understand the writer's intent and generate content accordingly.
