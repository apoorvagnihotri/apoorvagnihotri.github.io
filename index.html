<p>
    Hi! I am Apoorv Agnihotri, currently a Research Fellow at Wadhwani AI, based in Mumbai, India. 
    I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitgn.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar</a>
    with B.Tech. in <a href="https://cs.iitgn.ac.in/">Computer Science and Engineering</a>.
    I have been extremely fortunate to be guided by <a href="https://nipunbatra.github.io/">Prof. Nipun Batra</a> 
    and <a herf="https://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/">Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman</a>
    during my time at IIT Gandhinagar. 
</p>

<p>
    My interests lie in using Machine Learning for social good. I am 
    fascinated by Artificial Intelligence and it's potentially ubiquitous 
    use in making lives better for the under-served communities.
</p>

<p>
    I believe, we are only as rich as the people around us.
