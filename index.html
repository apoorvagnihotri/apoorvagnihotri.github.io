<p>
    Hi! I am Apoorv Agnihotri, a senior undergraduate in 
    <a href="https://cs.iitgn.ac.in/">Computer Science and 
    Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.iitgn.ac.in/">
    Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    My interests lie in using Machine Learing for social good. I am 
    facinated by Artificial Intelligence and it's potentially ubiquitous 
    use to solve social problems, be it reducing number of accidents 
    using self-driving cars or finding intervention policies for the 
    eradication of maleria.
</p>

<p>
    I hope to work on moonshots to contribute my share to the world 
    someday! Feel free to ping me at my <a href="mailto:apoorv.agnihotri@iitgn.ac.in">email</a>.
