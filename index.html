    Hi! I am Apoorv Agnihotri. I am often excited about using machine learning to solve problems. 
    I currently work as a Deep Learning Researcher at <a href="https://www.rephrase.ai/">Rephrase AI</a>
    on speech synthesis. Earlier, I graduated from <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/">IIT Gandhinagar</a>
    with a B.Tech. in <a href="https://cs.iitgn.ac.in/">Computer Science and Engineering</a>.

    Previously, I built computer vision solutions in healthcare and agriculture 
    at<a href="https://www.wadhwaniai.org/">Wadhwani AI</a> with 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahulap/">Dr. Rahul Alex Panicker</a>. During my time
    at IIT Gandhinagar I worked with <a href="https://nipunbatra.github.io/">Prof. Nipun Batra</a> on using 
    gaussian processses and active learning for computational sustainability.
